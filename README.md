<h2 id="what-is-hacking-space_invader">What is Hacking?
:space_invader:</h2>
#### <i>Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems or networks
to exploit its weaknesses to gain access.</i>
<p>
Hacking can be carried out in many ways. The most common form is the
phishing scam, where hackers attempt to gain login names and passwords,
or introduce malware into networked computing environments, by tricking
users into opening an email attachment or forwarding private
information. Some of the most serious breaches of recent years,
including the Wannacry malware attack, began as phishing scams,
affecting not just the target enterprise but associated partners,
customers, government agencies and others.

<h2 id="who-is-a-hacker-man_technologist">Who is a hacker?
:man_technologist:</h2>
<p>
A Hacker is a person who finds and exploits the weakness in computer
systems and/or networks to gain access. Hackers are usually skilled
computer programmers with knowledge of computer security. Hackers are
classified according to the intent of their actions. The following list
classifies hackers according to their intent.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)">White
hat</a>   A hacker who gains access to systems with a view to fix the
identified weaknesses. They may also perform penetration Testing and
vulnerability assessments</li>
<li><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)">Black
hat</a>   A hacker who gains unauthorized access to computer systems for
personal gain. The intent is usually to steal corporate data, violate
privacy rights, transfer funds from bank accounts etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat">Grey hat</a>   A
hacker who is in between ethical and black hat hackers. He/she breaks
into computer systems without authority with a view to identify
weaknesses and reveal them to the system owner. <br></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-ethical-hacking">What is Ethical-Hacking?</h2>
<p>
Ethical Hacking sometimes called as Penetration Testing is an act of
intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats,
vulnerabilities in those systems which a malicious attacker may find and
exploit causing loss of data, financial loss or other major damages. The
purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or
systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing. Ethical
hackers may use the same methods and tools used by the malicious hackers
but with the permission of the authorized person for the purpose of
improving the security and defending the systems from attacks by
malicious users. Ethical hackers are expected to report all the
vulnerabilities and weakness found during the process to the management.

<h2 id="what-is-cybersecurity-computer">What is Cybersecurity?
:computer:</h2>
<p>
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and
programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at
accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting
money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

are Ethical-Hacking-Tools? :man_technologist: :hammer_and_wrench:</h2>
<p>
Hacking Tools are computer programs and scripts that help you find and
exploit weaknesses in computer systems, web applications, servers and
networks. There are a variety of such tools available on the market.
Some of them are open source while others are commercial solutions.

<h2 id="what-is-ctf-triangular_flag_on_post">What is CTF?
:triangular_flag_on_post:</h2>
<p>
CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition
that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a
scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking
your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the
contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be
hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag,
hence the name! Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies
between the events. Some are targeted towards professionals with
experience operating on cyber security teams. These typically offer a
large cash reward and can be held at a specific physical location.

<h2 id="what-is-cryptography-currency_exchange">What is Cryptography?
:currency_exchange:</h2>
<p>
Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow
only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its
contents.When transmitting electronic data, the most common use of
cryptography is to encrypt and decrypt email and other plain-text
messages.Modern cryptography uses sophisticated mathematical equations
(algorithms) and secret keys to encrypt and decrypt data. Today,
cryptography is used to provide secrecy and integrity to our data, and
both authentication and anonymity to our communications.An example of
basic cryptography is an encrypted message in which letters are replaced
with other characters. To decode the encrypted contents, you would need
a grid or table that defines how the letters are transposed.

<p>There are a lot of resources out there in order to help you get
started with Ethical Hacking. These range from YouTube tutorials to
virtual lab environments where you can hone your skills.</p>

<h1 id="virtual-testing-environments">Virtual Testing Environments</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a> - Through VulnHub,
you can download VMs that have known vulnerabilities, your task is to
break into these and find the flags that have been listed by the
creator. This is a free service, you download the VM and run it in your
VM program of choice</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">Hack The Box</a> - In order to
even get signed up to Hack the Box, you need to hack into the site. Once
in, you will find a load of pre-made vulnerable boxes. No VM programs
are needed here as you access them all through a VPN. There is a free
tier but in order to access the retired machines you need to pay a
subscription.</li>
<li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/">Try Hack Me</a> - Similar to Hack
the Box but with a more guided learning approach. You can enroll
yourself in “classes” that will help you through what to look for when
hacking a machine. Again, all machines are accessed via a VPN.
Subscription is required for most of the content here</li>
